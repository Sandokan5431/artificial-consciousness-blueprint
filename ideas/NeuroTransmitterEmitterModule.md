## Neurotransmitter Module

In order to mimic biologically realistic neuromodulation, we add a **Neurotransmitter Module** that explicitly models neurotransmitter release centers (brain nuclei), their projection pathways

### Neurotransmitter Emitters (Projection Sources)

Each neurotransmitter system originates from a designated **Emitter Node** (analogous to Raphe nuclei, Locus Coeruleus, VTA, Hypothalamus, etc.).

Emitters control **production, release, and modulation** of neurotransmitters, with feedback loops from other neuromodulators and cortical outputs.

**Examples:**

- **Raphe Nuclei (RN):** Produces and projects serotonin (5-HT).
- **Locus Coeruleus (LC):** Produces and projects norepinephrine (NE).
- **Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA):** Produces and projects dopamine (DA).
- **Hypothalamus (HYP):** Produces oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin.
- **Basal Forebrain / Tuberomammillary Nucleus:** Produces histamine (HA).
- **Hypothalamic Orexin System:** Stabilizes wake/sleep with orexin (ORX).

Each **NeuroTransmitterEmitter** object:

- Has a **baseline production rate** (µ per tick).
- Has a **projection topology** (list of cortical/striatal targets).
- Its release can be **modulated by other neuromodulators** (e.g. DA ↑ can indirectly suppress 5HT production).
- Maintains a **dynamic concentration state**.

### Receptor Expression Profiles

At the receiving end, every target area expresses an **Array of Receptors**, each defined by:

- **Density `ρ`**: number of binding sites per receptor type.
- **Ostheosteric site (orthosteric)**: main active binding site; requires neurotransmitter "protein" match.
- **Allosteric site**: modulatory site that augments ost.

#### Binding Dynamics

- Each receptor has:

  - **Ostheosteric Vector** (receptor embedding).
  - **Allosteric Vector** (modulator-sensitive embedding).
  - **Latent embedding** describing cell-surface protein identity.

- Each neurotransmitter is represented as a **Protein Vector**, carrying:
  - Base embedding (molecular identity).
  - Instantaneous concentration level.
  - Internal NN (dimensions = concentration level).
  - Can only bind if **cosine similarity ≥ θ_bind** between transmitter vector and receptor site vector.

#### Activity Calculation

1. Binding Phase

   - For each receptor:  
     If neurotransmitter cosine similarity with orthosteric > θ, binding occurs.  
     Orthosteric contribution = `(NT_vector * sensitivity)`.

2. Allosteric Modulation

   - Bound allosteric proteins modify receptor output:  
     `orthosteric_signal * f(allosteric_vector)`

3. Saturation & Density

   - Signal strength scales with receptor **density ρ**.
   - Unbound receptors output 0.

4. Final Receptor Activity
   - Each receptor computes activity via NN:  
     Input dim = receptor density.  
     Weighted by neurotransmitter embedding and modulated outputs.
   - Aggregate receptor activities per area produce an **Effective Neuromodulator Influence Vector**.

### Homeostatic Neuromodulator System

The **Homeostatic Module** integrates the above projections with **dynamic receptor binding** and provides system-wide regulation:

- Maintains **neurochemical balance** via autoreceptor-like feedback (e.g. 5HT1A receptors suppress serotonin release).
- Tracks overall “brain milieu” vector:  
  `μ = {DA, 5HT, NE, OXT, TST, HA, ORX}`
- Regulatory functions:
  1. **Exploration/Exploitation Balance** (DA vs 5HT vs NE).
  2. **Social/Prosocial Biasing** (OXT, TST, 5HT).
  3. **Arousal States & Wakefulness** (HA, ORX).
  4. **Learning Drive** (DA novelty signaling).
  5. **Emotional Safety / Threat Aversion** (5HT gating).
  6. **Urgency / Crisis Mode** (NE bursts).
  7. **Sleep Switch Control** (histamine decay + orexin gating for transitions).

The homeostatic module therefore acts as a **cortical thermostat**, ensuring all modules work inside adaptive computational envelopes.

### Why This Design Matters

- **Embodiment of neurobiology**: neurotransmitters come from realistic projection centers (Raphe, VTA, LC).
- **High fidelity binding logic**: vector similarities with thresholds encode lock-and-key protein metaphor.
- **Allosteric modulation**: allows subtle control of receptor activity, mirrors pharmacology.
- **Neural Nets in Proteins and Receptors**:
  - NT “protein” nets: dynamic outputs based on level.
  - Receptor nets: plastic responses based on density.
- **System-level regulation**: Homeostat integrates activation into computational modulations for DMN/ACI loop (explore/exploit, urgency, safety, sleep/wake).
